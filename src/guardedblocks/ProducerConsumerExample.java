/**
 * Let's use guarded blocks to create a Producer-Consumer application. 
 * This kind of application shares data between two threads: the producer, that creates the data, 
 * and the consumer, that does something with it. The two threads communicate using a shared object. 
 * Coordination is essential: the consumer thread must not attempt to retrieve the data before the 
 * producer thread has delivered it, and the producer thread must not attempt to deliver new data if 
 * the consumer hasn't retrieved the old data.
 * 
 * In this example, the data is a series of text messages, which are shared through an object of type Drop:
